Project Overview
This project is a web application built with Next.js for a seamless frontend and backend integration, MongoDB as the database, DataGrip for database management, and Zod for schema validation on both client and server sides. This setup allows for efficient data handling, organized structure, and ensures data integrity with validation.
Tech Stack
•	Frontend: Next.js for server-rendered and static sites.
•	Backend: Next.js API routes to handle backend processes.
•	Database: MongoDB for flexible and scalable data storage.
•	Database Management: DataGrip, providing a layer for structured and organized management of MongoDB collections.
•	Validation: Zod for schema validation, used to ensure that data adheres to expected structures.
Project Architecture
1. Frontend (Next.js)
•	The frontend UI is developed in Next.js, allowing fast rendering and SEO-friendly pages.
•	API interactions from the frontend communicate with backend API endpoints, using Zod to validate data before submission.
2. Validation (Zod)
•	Zod is used as the validation library, providing schema definitions for data that flows through both frontend and backend.
•	Validation occurs on both sides, ensuring that only clean, well-structured data is processed, increasing robustness and minimizing errors.
•	Zod schemas are defined for each entity, enforcing data types, required fields, and constraints.
3. Backend (Next.js API Routes)
•	The backend logic is handled through Next.js API routes, which act as endpoints for the frontend to interact with.
•	Each endpoint connects to the MongoDB database, allowing for CRUD operations on the data.
•	API routes also use Zod validation to verify incoming requests, ensuring data integrity before interactions with MongoDB.
4. Database (MongoDB)
•	MongoDB is used for data storage due to its flexibility and scalability, making it ideal for handling JSON-like documents.
•	Collections within MongoDB are structured to align with application data needs, storing information efficiently and allowing fast retrieval.
5. Database Management (DataGrip)
•	DataGrip is used to manage the MongoDB database, adding a layer of control for database structure, indexing, and data organization.
•	DataGrip provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring, optimizing, and maintaining the MongoDB database, improving productivity and reliability.
Workflow Summary
1.	Frontend UI: The Next.js frontend provides a user interface, interacting with backend API routes to retrieve and display data.
2.	API Interaction: When data is sent to or retrieved from the server, it passes through the API routes, which handle backend logic.
3.	Validation: Zod validates data both client-side and server-side, ensuring it meets the required schema before processing.
4.	Database Operations: API routes interact with MongoDB, performing CRUD operations based on requests from the frontend.
5.	Database Management: DataGrip is utilized for efficient database management, allowing for organized data handling and effective monitoring of MongoDB collections.
