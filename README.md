üìã Project Overview
This project is a web application built with Next.js for seamless frontend and backend integration, MongoDB as the database, DataGrip for database management, and Zod for schema validation on both client and server sides. This setup ensures efficient data handling, an organized structure, and data integrity through validation.

üõ† Tech Stack
Frontend: Next.js for server-rendered and static sites.
Backend: Next.js API routes to handle backend processes.
Database: MongoDB for flexible and scalable data storage.
Database Management: DataGrip for organized management of MongoDB collections.
Validation: Zod for schema validation, ensuring adherence to expected data structures.
üèó Project Architecture
1. Frontend (Next.js)
Built with Next.js for fast rendering and SEO-friendly pages.
Frontend API interactions communicate with backend endpoints, with Zod validating data before submission.
2. Validation (Zod)
Zod provides schema definitions for data flowing through both frontend and backend.
Validates on both sides, ensuring that only clean, structured data is processed.
Zod schemas enforce data types, required fields, and constraints for each entity.
3. Backend (Next.js API Routes)
Backend logic is handled through Next.js API routes, serving as endpoints for frontend requests.
Connects to MongoDB for CRUD operations on data.
API routes utilize Zod to validate incoming requests, maintaining data integrity before MongoDB interactions.
4. Database (MongoDB)
MongoDB is selected for its flexibility and scalability in handling JSON-like documents.
Collections are structured to meet application needs, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.
5. Database Management (DataGrip)
DataGrip provides an organized interface for managing the MongoDB database structure, indexing, and organization.
Enhances productivity and reliability with tools for monitoring and optimizing database performance.
üîÑ Workflow Summary
Frontend UI: The Next.js frontend provides a user-friendly interface, interacting with backend API routes to retrieve and display data.
API Interaction: Data passes through API routes for backend logic.
Validation: Zod validates data on both client-side and server-side, ensuring compliance with schema requirements.
Database Operations: API routes interact with MongoDB for CRUD operations.
Database Management: DataGrip is used for efficient database management, organized data handling, and monitoring MongoDB collections.
